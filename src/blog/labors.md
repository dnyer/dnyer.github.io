<p>Something cute I found this afternoon while digging through a luggage chest I bought at an estate sale - what appears to be a love letter, or perhaps the draft of one, or the beginning of a wedding vow, with accompanying doodle of the presumed beloved (or lover?).</p>

<img src="/src/images/PXL_20250508_200701468.jpg" alt="The front of a 8&quot; x 5&quot; index card with a doodle of a person, with the accompanying text &quot;my curly burly love&quot; and &quot;gezundheit&quot;" title="The front of a 8&quot; x 5&quot; index card with a doodle of a person, with the accompanying text &quot;my curly burly love&quot; and &quot;gezundheit&quot;" width=100%>

<p>There's no date anywhere, but I'm guessing late 80s or early 90s based on other documents I found in the chest.</p>

<p>The text, as best I can tell:<br></p>
<p>my love            my love with the burly curly <s>crop ha</s><br>
        earl you            earl<br>
            my husband how i believe in our union<br>
                            <s>our love feels like it will be g</s><br>
                            <s>our love</s><br>
                the sense of you + i<br><br>
                there is true in 'you + i'<br>
                    <u>sense in being together</u><br>
                the only <s>right</s> sense i see for me<br>
                is <s>to</s> always to be together with thee.<br>
    Treasures                <s>feeling</s>    <s>sensing the adventures</s> <u>touching</u> , tasting , testing<br>
    together, touching tasting testing            a world of <s>adventure</s> good days<br>
        my love ,                <br>is ours
        <s>our days will be</s>good days we'll see.</p>
<p>I'm glad I found this little expression of love, tucked away, likely long forgotten, frozen in time. I hope their lives were as wonderful as they wanted them to be.<br>DBN</p>
