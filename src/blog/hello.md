<p>Okay. Let's take it from the top, one more time.</p>
									
<p>Creating a website has been a personal goal of mine for nearly two decades, now. After putting it off countless times, the combination of unemployment + learning Python + the death of social media has finally spurred me to action. So here it is: a tiny blog in the far reaches of the 'net. It feels a bit like when I bought my first motorcycle: this thing is small, and simple, but it is mine to maintain and use as I see fit.</p>

<p>I was expecting the process of making a website to be a lot more painful, to be honest. Domain registration, site hosting, slapping together enough HTML to make it readable - the whole process took maybe five hours. Yet another example of the size of the problem being much larger in my head than in reality I suppose.</p>

<p>So what will I be using this site for? Writing about whatever strikes my fancy, of course! I'd like to use it as a journal/notebook of sorts, recording my process of gaining knowledge, learning skills, and generally experiencing new or interesting things. Some topics I'm interested in include bicycling, programming, biotechnology, cooking, woodworking, and hiking/camping. So, pretty much what you'd expect from a guy who sets up his own website. I'd like to update this site at least weekly, and ideally more often, once I have the rest of the site sorted out. Pending my time, energy, and attention, of course.</p>

<p>See you around, hopefully.</p>
